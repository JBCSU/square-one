# GitHub Workflows

## `phpcs.yml`

Runs the PHPCS sniffs from the root of your projects. Define your standards in the `phpcs.yml` file.

### Usage

In order to leverage this code-sniffing workflow, this project will need:

1. A `GH_TOKEN` secret added to the repo under the project's Settings > Secrets page. This should be an active GitHub oAuth token.
1. The following secrets are also needed: `WP_PLUGIN_ACF_KEY`, `WP_PLUGIN_GF_KEY`, `WP_PLUGIN_GF_TOKEN`. These should be in the Square1 .env file in 1password.

## `eslint.yml`

This GitHub Workflow grants tr1b0t the ability to sniff and inline comment on PRs where the changed JS code differs from the agreed upon standards.

### Usage

Great news! Since we have an `.eslintrc` file, this action is already enabled.

In order to leverage this code-sniffing workflow, this project will need:

1. A `GH_BOT_TOKEN` secret added to the repo under the project's Settings > Secrets page. The secret can be found in 1Password in the General Systems vault (search for `GH_BOT_TOKEN`).
1. A `.eslintrc` file in the root of the project that declares the standards that should be used.
