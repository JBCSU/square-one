# Theme Icons

Icons for the system are powered by an icomoon generated kit, or by inline svg using [postcss-inline-svg](https://github.com/TrySound/postcss-inline-svg).

For the icomoon kit that powers the core theme, you will find the files generated by this system at `/dev_components/theme/icons/core`.

For accessible usage of font icons [see here](http://fontawesome.io/accessibility/).

## How to Add Icons to Core Theme

* Go to [icomoon](https://icomoon.io/app/#/projects)
* Create a new project. 
* Select import icons from top nav
* Import the `selection.json` in the dev folder
* Add your new icons to the kit
* Generate fonts using the settings from last round
* Overwrite all files in `/dev_components/theme/icons/core` with this new kit
* Copy the files from `/dev_components/theme/icons/core/fonts` to `/wp-content/themes/core/fonts/icons-core`
* Update `/wp-content/themes/core/pcss/base/_icons.pcss` with new values from `/dev_components/theme/icons/core/style.css`
