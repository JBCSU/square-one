# Forms

Square One comes with a set of form helper classes as well as a CSS "plugin" to also handle forms powered 
by Gravity Forms, a WordPress plugin. You can find the general set of form classes along with inline documentation 
here: `wp-content/themes/core/pcss/base/forms/`.

In addition to these classes, which are ready to be implemented in your markup from the start, we have built out 
a set of simple, more general variables (`wp-content/themes/core/pcss/utilities/variables/forms.pcss`) that should get 
you about 95% of the way to meeting your design. There is also a set of more granular variables to allow for 
heavier customization and fine tuning (`wp-content/themes/core/pcss/utilities/variables/forms/`).

TODO: add additional documentation for the form helpers (how to skin/theme, input icons, etc.)
