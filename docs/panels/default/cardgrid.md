The Card Grid panel is comprised of a panel title, text content, and a repeater field section to add, remove, and reorder cards.

Cards within the repeated are comprised of a Card Title (text field), Cards Description (textarea field), Image (WPML image uploader/selector), and a CTA (url, text label, window location).

### Usage

The Card Grid panel gives the appearance of typical card style loop you normally see in an E-commerce store, Pinterest (minus the mosaic layout), and other waffle style grid layouts. This panel allows you to create an easy loop of grid style CTAs for your site.
